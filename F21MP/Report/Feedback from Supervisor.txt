Abstract, Introduction, Motivation (10%)
8% Excellent
Abstract describes the project, but the dissertation abstract should describe the document. Does the introduction identifies a meaningful problem and the tool to solve the problem of students meeting dissertation deadlines. A more detailed description of what is being proposed could have been beneficial. Aims and objectives of the project are clear.


Literature Review (40%)
25% Excellent
The background section covers a large number of papers that were consulted, but often the presentation is too lengthy with little reflection on the link to the proposed work.
References and citations are appropriate.
Where the work is slightly deficient is in critiquing what is reviewed and establishing a link to the proposed work. A Related Work Section is missing and could include images for illustration.


Requirements and/or Proposed Methodology (incl. Evaluation) (30%)
21% Excellent
Are project requirements are clearly presented. Agile Solo is identified, but not elaborated.
The main dissertation will need to include diagrams and figures that have not been considered at this stage.
The work will be evaluated by 3 lecturers and 3 students, but more students will allow the collection of more feedback. It would be good to identify a benchmark, maybe from a project management perspective.


Project Plan (incl. Professional, Legal, Ethical, and Social Issues) (20%)
16% Excellent
Project plan, allocates time to learn tools and shows an iteration-based approach.
Both risk and PLES are discussed.
