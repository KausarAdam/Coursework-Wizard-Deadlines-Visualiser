Project evaluation (September Intake)

Learning Outcomes

On with some more practical advice this time on a very important of your projects: Evaluation!

This week we are going to cover one main topic and two sub-topics that might be applicable to you depending on the type of project you are proposing to do over the summer: Project Evaluation, Empirical Evaluation, and finally Human Evaluation.

In a nutshell, by the end of this week, you should be able to answer the following questions:

- Why do we need to evaluate?
- How can we evaluate?
- When and why do we need to set up an experiment? Also... what is an experiment in a Computer Science project? 
- How do we empirically evaluate a project? (Hint: use Automatic Metrics!)
- How do we conduct a human evaluation of our project?
